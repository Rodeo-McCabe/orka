# Orka

Orka is an OpenGL 4.6 rendering kernel written in Ada 2012. It provides
the building blocks to easily render 3D graphics or do general-purpose
computing on the GPU, and to use input devices like gamepads.

- **Object-oriented rendering API**. Renderer objects like shader programs,
vertex formats, framebuffers, buffers, and textures can be used via an
object-oriented API. Objects are automatically created and destroyed by using
controlled types. Various [AZDO][url-azdo] techniques can be used to allow
multithreaded buffer updates and batched draw calls for high performance rendering.

- **Debug rendering and logging**. Various packages exist that can be used
to draw bounding boxes, coordinate axes, lines, and spheres for debugging.
Messages from the rendering API or other parts of your application can be
logged to the terminal or files.

- **Joysticks and gamepads**. Joysticks and gamepads can be managed via
an API. Analog axes can be filtered with a low-pass filter, dead zones
can be removed, and axes and triggers can be inverted or normalized.
It is possible to detect chords (groups of buttons), button sequences,
and rapid button tapping.

- **Job graph processing system**. A job graph processing system provides
flexible multitasking by allowing work to be split into multiple small jobs
which are then processed by any available task from a task pool. Jobs can be
processed in parallel as well as sequentially.

- **Asynchronous resource loading**. Resources like [KTX][url-ktx] textures
and [glTF][url-gltf] models are loaded asynchronously using the job graph
processing system. Resources can be loaded from directories and archive files.

- **Quaternions and matrices**. Packages for applying common transformations
to vectors, quaternions, and matrices using x86 SIMD instructions are provided.
The various x86 SIMD extensions like SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSE4.1, AVX, and F16C
can also be used directly in your own code.

Additionally, Orka provides several bindings:

- **OpenGL 4.6**. Thick bindings are provided for the modern parts
of OpenGL 4.6. There are no bindings for fixed function functionality
that is deprecated or functions that have been superseded by newer extensions.

- **GLFW 3**. Provides bindings for [GLFW 3.x][url-glfw]. This
is a library for creating windows with an OpenGL context on them. It also
provides functionality for capturing user input on keyboard, mouse, and
joystick. Alternatively, libraries like [SDL][url-sdl] can be
used instead to create windows and process input.

## Learning Ada

Ada is an imperative and object-oriented programming language focused
on correctness, readability, and good [software engineering practices][url-swe-practices]
for large scale systems and safety-critical and embedded real-time systems.

It has a very strong static type system where you can create your own
types that reflect the problem domain, with optional low-level control
of your data. Packages provide modularity and information hiding. High-level
concurrency primitives like protected objects allow safe communication
between tasks and design-by-contract is supported through type invariants,
predicates, and pre- and postconditions.

If you would like to learn Ada, then here are a few resources to get started:

- [Introduction to Ada][url-learn-act] (An interactive tutorial in your browser)

- [Ada Programming on Wikibooks][url-wikibooks]

- [(Online) books on Awesome Ada][url-awesome]
